++ CRAB3-GlideinWMS - MetaPackage ++

This repository will make a VM with the relevant CRAB3-GWMS source
trees checked out, as well as the necessary dependencies. Useful if you're
like me and manage to spill water on your laptop, but still want to
develop

++ To start ++

  1. Install VirtualBox (virtualbox.org) and Vagrant (vagrantup.com) to
     your machine.
  2. Run ./bootstrap.sh -- this initializes the necessary git repositories
     and performs some minimal initialization tasks
  3. From within this directory (or a subdirectory), run `vagrant up` to
     download/boot the VM
  4. From within this directory (or a subdirectory). run `vagrant ssh` to
     connect to the VM via ssh
  5. Hack
  6. Use `vagrant suspend` to stop the VM or `vagrant destroy` to delete
     the VM
